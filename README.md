# Smart Email Client
Initial project setup for Open Source Software Development assignment

## 📋 About This Project

**Smart Email Client** is a component-based mail system that demonstrates professional software architecture through clean separation of concerns. Built as a learning project for modern Python development practices, it showcases the "forklift test" principle - where the Gmail implementation can be completely replaced with any other email provider without changing a single line of interface code.

### Project Highlights:
- 🏗️ **Clean Architecture:** Interface and implementation completely decoupled
- 🔧 **Modern Tooling:** Integration of 5 professional Python development tools
- 🔐 **Secure Authentication:** OAuth2 flow with Gmail API integration
- 🧪 **Comprehensive Testing:** Unit, integration, and system test coverage
- 📚 **Professional Documentation:** Complete setup guides and API documentation
- 🚀 **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated quality gates and deployment workflows

### Learning Objectives Achieved:
- ✅ Interface design and dependency injection patterns
- ✅ Professional Python toolchain mastery (uv, ruff, mypy, pytest, mkdocs)
- ✅ API integration with external services
- ✅ Automated quality control and testing strategies
- ✅ Technical documentation and project organization

This implementation serves as a foundation for building scalable, maintainable email client systems while demonstrating industry-standard development practices.
